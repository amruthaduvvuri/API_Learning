🚀 API Learning Journey – **Day 01**

Through this repository, I’m revising on different ways of using APIs.
I’m documenting my progress day-by-day, revising on how to
- Send API requests
- Handle responses
- Work with JSON data
- Use Python libraries like `requests`
- Build simple real-world use cases

🚀 API Revising – **Day 02**

Today’s learning:

- Played with the OpenWeather API 🌧️🌤️
- Fetched real-time weather info
- Hid the API key so nobody steals it (security + clean code ✅)
- Next goal: Build something cool with multiple APIs

 This is **Day 03** of my API learning streak.
Today, I built a simple Crypto Price Tracker using the public CoinGecko API.

It takes a cryptocurrency name as input (Ex: bitcoin, ethereum, solana) and shows:

- ✅ Current price
- ✅ 24-hour high & low
- ✅ 24-hour price change %
- ✅ Market trend indicator (📈 rising / 📉 falling / stable)
  
More learning updates coming soon ✅
