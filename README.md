🚀 API Learning Journey – Day 01

Through this repository, I’m exploring different ways of using APIs.
I’m documenting my progress day-by-day, learning how to

	•	Send API requests
  
	•	Handle responses
  
	•	Work with JSON data
  
	•	Use Python libraries like requests
  
	•	Build simple real-world use cases

This was Day 01 of learning — starting with the basics and successfully making my first API calls!

More learning updates coming soon ✅
